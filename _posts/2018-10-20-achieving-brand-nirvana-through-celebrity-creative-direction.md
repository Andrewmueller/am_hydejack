title: Achieving Brand Nirvana Through Celebrity Creative Direction!

For many brands, hiring a celebrity as a creative director makes a lot of sense. Celebrities often represent the aspirations of their fans — beauty, charisma, strength, health, wealth, hip factor, and intelligence come to mind. When the brands is aligned with the same or complimentary attributes a celebrity Creative Director can have significant impact.

No wonder we are seeing this trend gaining momentum. But for full impact, this needs to be more than a honorary title.

To realize the full potential, the celebrity must share the same values as the brand, is naturally creative like a musician or actor, can work well with others, and is deeply connected to the demographic that the brand wants to reach.

When this comes together the celebrity has the potential to drive creative direction in ways that truly inspire customers. The brand then gets lift from both association with the celebrity and the creative output of that celebrity. Otherwise it is merely honorary appointment in exchange for endorsement — this has value, just not nearly as much. You will see both these scenarios as the trend continues.

To understand why this is so important we need to look at the role that social media is playing in our lives. [I’ve talked about this before](http://www.muellerandrew.com/2009/06/social-media-has-profoundly-changed-our-lives-and-in-turn-business/):

> The social web has begun a profound and irreversible cultural change.  The ease and speed at which information is transferred and the ability to share knowledge and opinion with each other, enables us to align ourselves in numerous flexible ungoverned groups. The alignments, immediacy, and interactions that take place give us a feeling of belonging that is core to what it means to be human. Our busy lives in modern western society have largely limited these types of analog interactions and the Social Web is filling the gap.

Social Media has changed our culture and is creating opportunities for brands to deliver experiences that fill customer need that extend far beyond those traditionally filled by the brand. In the process the brand can create stronger customer relationships and loyalty.

Brands know this and understand that they need to lead people and give them something to align with.  The association with the brand becomes part of that person's identity. They often don’t know how to do this though.

Celebrity Creative Director’s is a good first step. When a celebrity steps into the picture they can reinforce the alignment. When the celebrity contributes to the creative direction of products and messaging and puts their unique vision into them, it could further solidify the alignment.

Ultimately this could result in the ability for the brand to transcend traditional supply and demand relationship and sell more goods at a higher price with greater frequency — brand nirvana.
